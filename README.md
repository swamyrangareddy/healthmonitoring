error note:
when entering the email and password on the login page. the backend is not working. When the button is clicked it directly to the next page without checking the conditions. the data doesn't store the values in the database. the nodemailer also not sending the verification emails. 
the Post and Get methods are correct. I don't understand which condition went wrong.
